# Technical Overview
Cabana Identity taps into the power of several key technologies to offer a decentralized and privacy-centric identity management experience.

## Key Technical Components

* **EVM-compatible blockchain**: Allows for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to interact with user identity data.
* **Confidential VM technology**: Enables secure computation within the blockchain environment, protecting sensitive data.
* **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards**: Ensures interoperability with other SSI solutions and promotes a broader ecosystem.
* **Cryptography libraries**: Implement secure cryptographic algorithms for data encryption, signing, and verification.


## Identity Management
* **Private Accounts**: Users manage their identity through a main account, controlling private keys and storing identity data.
* **Personas**: Users create pseudonymous personas linked to their main account. Each persona can hold a subset of identity attributes tailored for specific interactions, offering granular control over information sharing.
* **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Instead of sharing raw data, users present VCs issued by trusted authorities. These VCs prove specific attributes (e.g., age, education) without revealing any underlying details, enhancing privacy.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: For even stronger privacy, users can leverage ZKPs to prove they possess certain attributes without revealing the specific values. This allows for sensitive information verification without compromising confidentiality.

## Security and Trust

* **Dynamic Security**: Cabana Identity implements a dynamic security framework that adapts to user risk profiles and suggests additional security measures based on activity and interaction patterns.
* **Reputation Scores**: Both individuals and organizations have reputation scores built from verified actions and community feedback. These scores help users make informed decisions about who to trust and interact with.
* **Open System**: Developers can extend custom services on top of Cabana Identity, such as adding Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to credentials, expanding its functionality and fostering innovation within the ecosystem.

## Access Control

* **User-Defined Login Policies**: Users configure multi-factor authentication and other access control measures for their main account.
* **Persona-Specific Access Grants**: Applications require explicit access grants for each persona used, preventing unauthorized access to personal data.
* **Cloak IDs**: Creating unique relationship identifiers to differentiate personas across applications and organization mitigates correlation risks while still supporting Proof of Personhood use cases.

## Trust and Reputation

* **Identity Scores**: Users accrue identity scores based on the amount of verifiable information added to their accounts, reflecting trust based on data completeness.
* **Reputation Scores**: Both individuals and organizations have reputation scores influenced by verified actions and community feedback, providing indicators of reliability and trustworthiness.
* **Decentralized Verification**: Organizations can offer identity verification services, authentication methods, and authorization providers, contributing to the overall trust ecosystem.

## 
The above is a glimpse into the underlying mechanisms powering Cabana Identity's decentralized and privacy-preserving identity management system. Cabana Identity aims to empower users and organizations with control over their data and interactions while fostering a secure and trustworthy online environment.

# The Big Picture

Cabana Identity puts you in the driver's seat of your online identity. You pick what you share, how you share it, and who you trust, all within a secure and dynamic network that fosters genuine connections and empowers you to navigate the digital world with confidence.

`Democratized Control`: You're at the center. You hold your own private keys and manage your identity through a main account. You create "personas" for different situations, choosing what information to share with each application or service. No more one-size-fits-all online profiles!

`Privacy-Conscious Sharing`: Gone are the days of handing over your entire digital life. With Cabana Identity, you leverage "verifiable credentials" that prove specific attributes (like age or student status) without revealing everything. It's like showing your driver's license for age verification without handing over your address.

`Dynamic Trust`: Building trust online shouldn't be a blind leap. Cabana Identity introduces "reputation scores" for both individuals and organizations. These scores, influenced by verified actions and community feedback, help you make informed decisions about who to interact with. As you interact with others and participate in the community, your Cabana reputation score evolves.

## Oasis Sapphire

Cabana Identity chooses Oasis Sapphire for its groundbreaking confidential computing capabilities. At the core of 
Sapphire is the integration of trusted execution environments (TEEs) - where smart contract code can 
execute and keep state details private. Sapphire enables advanced confidential smart contracts otherwise 
impossible using traditional blockchain platforms. 


* **Decentralized Blockchain**: Sapphire is the first blockchain of its kind to offer a decentralized architecture with a Confidential VM, offering data privacy on a global, open, and permissionless network.
* **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)**: Sensitive data like private keys and identity credentials are stored and processed within a TEE. This protects your data even from the blockchain itself.
* **EVM Compatibility**: This enables development of custom smart contracts for application-specific verification and access control mechanisms.
* **End-to-End Encryption**: Communication between clients and the blockchain is secured with end-to-end encryption, adding another layer of data protection.

## Open Protocol

Cabana Identity builds its own permissionless smart contract protocol on top of the Sapphire Network. This allows for a decentralized and privacy-preserving identity management experience.

Cabana Identity leverages confidential transactions to keep sensitive business data encrypted while still allowing validation that regulatory policies are being enforced properly.

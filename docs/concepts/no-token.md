# Tokenomics

There is no token.

Cabana has no token of its own. It's designed for frictionless integration and to enrich existing token utility on other protocols.  The success of Cabana is about bringing success to our partners.

[//]: # (Identity is about people, not tokens. We believe once a token is introduced, it becomes a step toward vendor and ecosystem lock in. This fails to support the user-centric methodology. Individuals should be able to use their own identity tools and be free to move between systems without friction.)

Cabana Identity is a suite of user-centric tools that help facilitate identity management. At any time, individuals can choose to use other tools or directly interact with permissionless smart contracts.
